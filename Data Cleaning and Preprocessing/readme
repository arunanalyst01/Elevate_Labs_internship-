# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Customer Dataset
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset as part of a data preparation task. The dataset contains common real-world issues such as missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, and mixed data types.

The goal is to transform the raw data into a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis or visualization.
## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Cleaning Steps Performed

1. Handled Missing Values 
   - Identified columns with nulls using `.isnull().sum()`.
   - Filled missing values in numeric columns with median values.
   - Replaced missing text entries with a placeholder (e.g., `'Not specified'`).

2. Removed Duplicates
   - Used `.drop_duplicates()` to eliminate duplicate rows.

3. Standardized Categorical Text  
   - Normalized entries in columns like `gender` and `country` to ensure consistency.
   - Examples: `'M' → 'male'`, `'f' → 'female'`, `'usa' → 'USA'`, etc.

4. Date Format Normalization  
   - Converted inconsistent date strings into `datetime` format using `pd.to_datetime()`.

5. Renamed Columns  
   - Cleaned up column headers by converting to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.

6. Data Type Fixes
   - Ensured correct data types: e.g., `age` as integer, `signup_date` as datetime.

7.  Outlier Removal  
   - Applied IQR filtering to remove outliers in numerical columns like `income`.

## Learning Goals

By completing this project, I gained experience in:
- Identifying and addressing common data issues
- Using Pandas for real-world data wrangling
- Structuring a dataset for future analysis or modeling

This project is part of my data analytics journey and will serve as a reference for future work.
